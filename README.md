# Insect Invasion
Insect invasion is a puzzle game where the player must solve mazes by opening and closing doors to evade evil enemies. 

The original game is made in processing (Java) by me and a few classmates for our first group project. The goal of the project was to make an endless arcade game.

I later decided to remake the game in JS using the p5.js library so that I could upload it to [itch.io](https://rigterw.itch.io/insect-invasion).
